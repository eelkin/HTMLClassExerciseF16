      <h2>Welcome to my site. Please come in and say awhile!</h2>
      <p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday.
      <br>But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products,
      and they've been quite a hit.</p>
      <p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures,
      stories, and films.
      <br>And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things
      Halloween.</p>
