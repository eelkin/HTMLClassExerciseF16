        <p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday.
        But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products,
        and they've been quite a hit.</p>
        <p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures,
        stories, and films.
        And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things
        Halloween.</p>
